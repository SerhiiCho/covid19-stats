                        Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small
                        droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be
                        breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface
                        they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.

                    <p>
                        So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your
                        face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with
                        infected people are important for limiting the spread.

                        This follows a study suggesting that the virus can travel
                        further in coughs and sneezes than previously thought.

                    <h2>What are the coronavirus symptoms?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Coronavirus infects the lungs. The two main, key symptoms are
                        a fever and a dry cough, which can in some cases lead to
                        breathing problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cough to look out for is a new, continuous cough. This
                        means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or having three
                        or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (and if you usually
                        have a cough, it may be worse than usual).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have a fever if your temperature is above 37.8C. This can
                        make you feel warm, cold or shivery.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                            >five days on average to start showing the symptoms,</a
                        >
                        scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much
                        later than this. In fact the World Health Organization (WHO)
                        says the incubation period lasts up to 14 days.

                    <p>
                        A sore throat, headache and diarrhoea have also been reported
                        in some cases and
